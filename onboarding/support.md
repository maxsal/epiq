## Approvals

### Initial MGI Participant Data for Pilot
We submitted a ticket via the [DOCTR-JIRA data request system](https://doctrjira.med.umich.edu/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) for data on EPI-Q eligible participants in MGI. The ticket assigned to this request was <b>HPI-3993</b>. The request was initially submitted on 6 September 2019 ahead of IRB approval to speed up the process. In early December 2019, Erin's team said the data had been pulled and they were waiting on Central Biorepository (CBR) steering committee approval to release the data. Shortly after, Erin's team identified an issue with different consent forms for early MGI enrollees and MIPACT participants, which would render some people ineligible for recontact for EPI-Q. As of 9 January 2020, Erin's team claims we should receive this data pull by the end of January 2020. Anisa Driscoll appears to be the person on Erin's team leading this pull.

## Compliance

### Information Assurance compliance review for use of CareEvolution/MyDataHelps in EPI-Q
We needed to seek compliance approval to ensure that MyDataHelps met security protocol standards required for human subjects research and the nature of the data being collected through Michigan Medicine's [Service Now portal](https://michmed.service-now.com/sp/). We were assigned ticket <b>INC0733653</b>. A parallel request with ID <b>RITM0051084</b> was also created. Two things came up through this review process:
1. There was a concern that the data being collected qualified as protected health (PH) information. Ultimately, the determination was made that data collected through EPI-Q does not qualify as PH and, thus, does not require additional review for stricter security protocols. <br/>
2. Kendall DuBois said that MyDataHelps was previously reviewed and approved for use in a similar study. She sought blanket approval for MyDataHelps for use in data collection efforts that do not collect PH data.
Imani Williams, a vulnerability analyst at Michigan Medicine's Information Assurance, said "based on Complianceâ€™s ruling and our previous reviews of this app, nothing more is needed from a cybersecurity standpoint," indicating compliance approval for use of MyDataHelps in EPI-Q.
