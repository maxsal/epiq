# Protocol

Last updated: 9 January 2020

Full protocol can be found in the Documentation folder on the Google Shared Drive (dated: 20190725).

## Investigators

<b>Principal Investigator</b>: Bhramar Mukherjee<br/>
<b>Co-Investigators</b>: Lars Fritsche, Sachin Kheterpal, Lynda Lisabeth, Chad Brummett, Amy Cohn

## Aims
1. To collect information from MGI subjects on a broad range of health-related lifestyle, behavioral, and risk factor topics<br/>
2. To share the survey data back to the RDW for future linkage and use permitted by this IRB and their consent to approved researchers<br/>
3. To engage research subjects by sharing returning their data contributions to them through a summary dashboard<br/>

## Eligibility

### Inclusion criteria
* Age 18 or over<br/>
* Enrolled in MGI (defined as participants already enrolled in HUM00071298, HUM00097962, and HUM00099605)
* Having a current email or mailing address in RDW for use in sending an invitation to participation

### Exclusion criteria
* Age < 18 years old<br/>
* Listed as deceased in the EPIC or RDW data sets at the time of invitations<br/>

## Methods of contact

The current IRB approved protocol states that we will use three methods of contact:
1. E-mail<br/>
2. Postal mail<br/>
3. MyDataHelps software application<br/>

For subjects whose e-mail is availble, we will contact them by e-mail.
For those whose e-mail is not available, we will contact them by postal mail.
If a subject is already using the MyDataHelps software application, we can send a direct invitation through the application.
Unsolicited outbound recruitment phone calls will not be made.

## Methods of administration

The survey will be administered electronically and can be completed using a mobile application or web browser.<br/>
A paper form is also available.

## Questionnaire contents

The baseline questionnaire is the primary objective of the survey and completion of the baseline modules is considered necessary and sufficient for receipt of the incentive. We believe the baseline survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.<br/>
The optional modules are completed on a voluntary basis. Participants do not receive any incentive for completing any of the optional modules. Participants may pick and choose any optional module to complete and they may be completed in any order. We believe it will take approximately 30 minutes to complete all of the additional, optional modules.<br/>
Participants in the pilot subsample will be invited to complete an optional, voluntary feedback survey following the completion of the baseline module. We expect it to take about 5 minutes to complete.

## Consent

By consenting to participate in EPI-Q, participants agree to the following:
1. The future undefined research use of their survey data by approved researchers
2. The linkage of their survey data with other subject-level data at the request of approved researchers
3. Access to their previously contribued genotype data (as part of MGI) for the sole purpose of preparing ancestry results
4. Future re-contact about EPI-Q or for other studies

The consent form will be completed via a electronic consent module in MyDataHelps.

## Incentives

Two incentive schemes are being randomly assigned as part of the pilot subsample for EPI-Q:
1. A free ancestry results (based on DNA they have previously provided through their participation in MGI)
2. A $10 gift card reward

The IRB will be amended prior to the full roll-out clarifying the incentive scheme to be used for all participants.

## End of Participation

Participation takes place immediately after recruitment. Participants will be allowed to end their involvement in the study at any time. Participation will be deemed "complete" upon completiong of the baseline survey.

### Withdrawn participant data
If a participant ends involvement in the study during the survey, their survey data will not be stored or analyzed.

If a participant withdraws form the study following the baseline survey, their survey data will be destroyed.

If a participant asks to withdraw from the original MGI study, the withdrawal request will be forwarded to the original MGI study team for withdrawal according to the approved protocol.

### Data Retention and Use

Data will be retained at the Research Data Warehouse (RDW) <b>indefinitely<b/>. Data may be used for research projects within the scope of the protocol. Before analysis, either at UM or outside the institution, data will be stripped of contact information and coded, unless the researchers have obtained additional ethical and regulatory board approvals to utilize identifiable data.
