# Administration

## Survey modalities

EPI-Q will primarily be administered through MyDataHelps' mobile application. At this time, <i>the consent form must be completed via the mobile application</i>. Completing the consent via a web browser is a function we've expressed interest in to CareEvolution and they said will be available at a later date.

After MyDataHelps registration and completion of EPI-Q consent, participants can complete the survey electronically through the MyDataHelps mobile application on their phone or online via a web browser.

An IRB approved paper form version of the survey is also available only as a last resort (i.e., in the event an eligible and interest participant is unable to complete it electronically or expresses it as their personal preference).

## RKStudio
[RKStudio](https://careevolution.com/rkstudio/) is the online interface that allows the EPI-Q team to program, test, and distribute the survey to participants. CareEvolution has created a [user guide](https://rkstudio-support.careevolution.com/hc/en-us) that explains how to create surveys, program question steps, skip logic and validation, and schedule and send surveys.

The RKStudio online interface allows you to test surveys with the "Try It Out" button. You can also download an app called RKStudioReview to test the survey on a mobile interface. For an authentic experience, you can add yourself to a survey with the email format "username+###@email.com" (e.g., add "+123" to your email address). The email invite will be sent to your "username@email.com" account.
