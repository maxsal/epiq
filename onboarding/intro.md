## Background

The Michigan Genomics Initiative ([MGI](https://precisionhealth.umich.edu/michigangenomics/)) is a biobank at the University of Michigan that started in 2012. The goal is to create a massive health database that links to many data sources for the purposes of quickly performing hypothesis-free/hypothesis-generating studies and to speed up the ability to perform hypothesis-specific research, particularly with genetic data. The key characteristics of the current MGI consent are:
1. Indefinite access to Michigan Medicine electronic health record (EHR) for research purposes
2. Provision of biospecimen (blood, spit) for genotyping
3. Linkage of EHR + genotype data to any other data that the Research Data Warehouse (RDW) can relate that participant to (e.g., administrative claims data through Medical Record Number or Social Security Number)
4. Permission for future re-contact for research purposes
The initial MGI consent (for roughly the first 15,000 participants) made part 4. an optional, opt-in feature. The current consent makes this opt-out. MGI data are available to UM researchers who have the appropriate permissions and approval.
To date (January 2020), there are 80,000+ individuals who have consented, 70,000 individuals who have provided specimen, and 45,000 with readily available genotype data.

The MGI Epidemiological Questionnaire (EPI-Q) serves to collect broad health-related information that cannot be readily or accurately obtained through linkable databases.
