## Background

The Michigan Genomics Initiative ([MGI](https://precisionhealth.umich.edu/michigangenomics/)) is a biobank at the University of Michigan that started in 2012. The goal is to create a massive health database that links to many data sources for the purposes of quickly performing hypothesis-free/hypothesis-generating studies and to speed up the ability to perform hypothesis-specific research, particularly with genetic data. The key characteristics of the current MGI consent are:
1. Indefinite access to Michigan Medicine electronic health record (EHR) for research purposes
2. Provision of biospecimen (blood, spit) for genotyping
3. Linkage of EHR + genotype data to any other data that the Research Data Warehouse (RDW) can relate that participant to (e.g., administrative claims data through Medical Record Number or Social Security Number)
4. Permission for future re-contact for research purposes
The initial MGI consent (for roughly the first 15,000 participants) made part 4. an optional, opt-in feature. The current consent makes this opt-out. MGI data are available to UM researchers who have the appropriate permissions and approval.
To date (January 2020), there are 80,000+ participants who have consented, 70,000 participants who have provided specimen, and 45,000 with readily available genotype data. MGI recruits roughly 10,000 participants per year.

<b>MGI Cohorts</b> There are currently three main MGI cohorts:
1. <b>MGI periop</b> The MGI perioperative cohort is the largest and recruits adult patients receiving anesthesia for surgical or diagnostic procedures at all Michigan Medicine operating roooms. It is led by [Chad Brummett](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/pain-research/chad-brummett-md).
2. <b>MGI MEND</b> The MGI Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetes (MEND) cohort is a subcohort that recruits through Michigan Medicine's Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetes clinics. It is led by [Charles (Chuck) Burant](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/burant-charles.html).
3. <b>MGI MHB</b> The MGI Mental Health Biobank cohort recruits through Michigan Medicine's mental health clinics. It is led by [Srijan Sen](https://www.srijan-sen-lab.com/people).

When referring to MGI, the MGI periop cohort is always being referenced. It sometimes includes MGI MEND and MGI MHB as well. Sometimes, MGI refers to all cohorts who are recruited using the consent criteria above, including the following ongoing or forthcoming cohorts:
1. <b>MGI Big Bird</b> The MGI Big Bird cohort is relatively new and is targeted as recruiting children. It is currently the only MGI cohort recruiting children.
2. <b>MIPACT</b> MIPACT is a subcohort of MGI that partners with Apple. These individuals receive Apple Watches and portable blood pressure cuffs for additional data collection. They are often considered separate from MGI due to the partnership with Apple (different consent form - notably they are not allowed to be recontacted).
3. <b>General Population</b> MGI is about to launch a new cohort that aims to recruit individuals seeking medical care from Michigan Medicine through outpatient clinics. This has not yet launched.
4. <b>UT-Austin</b> MGI is in talks with the University of Texas - Austin about recruiting a cohort there. The primary goal of this is to diversify the representation within MGI, primarily among Hispanics, but also among Blacks. This has not yet launched.

<b>Major Biobanks</b> The most significant biobank is the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk), a biobank in the United Kingdom comprised 500,000 participants aged 40-69 that links EHR, genetic, and survey data and is publicly accessible. Other notable biobanks include the National Institutes of Health's <i>[All of Us](https://allofus.nih.gov)</i>, Vanderbilt's [BioVU](https://victr.vumc.org/biovu-description/), the [Million Veteran Program](https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/), the [China Kadoorie](https://www.ckbiobank.org/site/) biobank, the [Geisinger MyCode](https://www.geisinger.org/mycode) initiative, and the [Kaiser Permanente Research Bank].(https://researchbank.kaiserpermanente.org).

For a brief overview of biobanks, major biobanks, and biobank-based research, refer to the first half of the [Beesley et al. 2019 paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.8445).

<b>EPI-Q</b> The MGI Epidemiological Questionnaire (EPI-Q) serves to collect broad health-related information that cannot be readily or accurately obtained through linkable databases. Its development went through the following phases:
* <b>Initial</b> The EPI-Q is based on the publicly available [UK Biobank survey](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Touchscreen-questionnaire-for-website_Copyright.pdf). 
  * The survey was broken up into distinct modules. Modules were reviewed for their utility in the case of EPI-Q considering the administration format and cross-sectional nature; some modules were identified as <i>baseline</i> modules and others <i>optional</i>. For example, because it is self-administered via electronic software and is collected cross-sectionally, the diet module was identified as being optional.
  * Questions were reviewed for clarity and adapted by the study team for an American audience.
  * Other biobank surveys were reviewed to compare similarities and identify gaps (i.e., modules/topics that are not present in the UK Biobank). These surveys include the MGI perioperative baseline survey, the <i>[All of Us](https://allofus.nih.gov/about/protocol/all-us-health-surveys)</i> initiative, and [Genes for Good](https://genesforgood.sph.umich.edu). All of Us received priority in identifying new modules/topics for inclusion as well as instruments/items to use to adapt UK Biobank survey for an American audience.
  * Initial feedback from domain experts was collected on specific questions who recommended alterations and suggested alternative instruments for consideration.
* <b>ISR</b> After this initial construction, the survey draft was shared with the [Survey Research Center](https://www.src.isr.umich.edu) at the [Institute for Social Research](https://isr.umich.edu). Max went through several revisions and met with [Lisa Holland](https://www.src.isr.umich.edu/people/lisa-holland/). Topics included:
  * Adaption for American audience
  * Consistency of response options within and across questions
  * Survey flow - in what order to ask questions, what skip logic seems most appropriate, etc.
  * Respondent burden - clarity, ease of understanding, topic comfortability, length of survey
* <b>More revisions</b> More revisions were made, more modules were added, and more domain experts were consulted, including:
  * Alcohol, cancer, sexual activity, smoking: [Andrew Brouwer](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/brouwer_andrew.html), [Jihyoun Jeon](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/jeon-jihjeon.html), and [Rafael Meza](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/meza-rafael.html)
  * Healthcare access and utilization: [Minal Patel](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/patel-minal.html)
  * Occupational exposure (context): [Richard Neitzel](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/neitzel-richard.html) and [Sung Kyun Park](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/park-sungkyun.html)
  * Physical activity: [Belinda Needham](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/needham-belinda.html)
  * General feedback (including all the above): [Michael Boehnke](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/boehnke-michael.html), [Anita Pandit](https://precisionhealth.umich.edu/about/staff/), [Sebastian Z\H{o}llner](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/zollner-sebastian.html),
